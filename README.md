# Dead Target

This is a multiplayer guessing game where you try to guess your opponent code with each guess verified by a zk proof to avoid cheating. When the game is about to begin, we hash your solution and save it on-chain. When you guess, we make sure the hashes match. You might need $ONE to play this game. Enjoy.
